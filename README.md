# Excel Crowd Funding Challenge
Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.

To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organizations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects in an attempt to discover “the trick” to finding success. 
To identify if a project is a sucess several types of explatory analysis were conducted using excel functions. The table below shows the relationship between category of project and the sucess rate of the project.
